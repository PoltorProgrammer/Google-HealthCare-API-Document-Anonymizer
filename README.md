## Configuration Guide (Administrator)

This section explains how to set up the Google Cloud resources required for **Real Mode**. If you are just testing the app in Simulation Mode, you can skip this.

### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project
1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Click the project dropdown at the top of the page and select **"New Project"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `clinical-data-app`) and click **Create**.
4.  Copy the **Project ID** (it might be `clinical-data-app-12345`). You will need this for `config.json`.

### Step 2: Enable the DLP API
1.  In the search bar at the top, type **"Data Loss Prevention API"** and select it.
2.  Click **Enable**.

### Step 3: Get Credentials (The Key File)
The app needs permission to access the DLP service.
1.  Go to **[IAM & Admin > Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts)**.
2.  Click **Create Service Account**.
    *   **Name**: `dlp-access`.
    *   **Access**: Give it the role **"DLP User"** (or Owner for testing).
    *   Click **Done**.
3.  Click on the email address of the service account you just created.
4.  Go to the **Keys** tab (at the top).
5.  Click **Add Key** > **Create new key**.
6.  Select **JSON** and click **Create**.
7.  A file will download to your computer.
    *   **Action**: Rename this file to `credentials.json` and move it into the `Google-HealthCare-API` folder (where the `.bat` files are).

### Step 4: Update config.json
Open `config.json` with Notepad (or TextEdit on Mac) and fill in your Project ID:

```json
{
    "google_cloud": {
        "project_id": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
        "service_account_key_file": "credentials.json"
    },
    "app_settings": {
        "simulation_mode": false
    }
}
```
*Note: Set `"simulation_mode": false` to actually use the Google Cloud connection.*

## How to Use

Once the application is running (see **Installation & Usage Guide** above):

1.  **Select Folder**: Click the **"Select Data Folder"** button and choose the directory on your computer containing the text files you want to anonymize.
2.  **Review Files**: The application will list all files found in the "Pending Documents" list.
3.  **Start Processing**: Click **"Start Processing"**.
    *   The app will read each file one by one.
    *   It sends the text securely to Google Cloud DLP.
    *   It receives the anonymized text back.
    *   A new file is saved in a `processed/` subfolder (e.g., `processed/anonymized_patient_01.txt`).
4.  **Completion**: Once finished, you will see a confirmation message. You can find your safe, anonymized documents in the `processed` folder inside your original source folder.
